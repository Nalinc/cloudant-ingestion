resource for  reading writing and speaking While it is  true that the dictionary is a useful tool that  can provide valuable information about  vocabulary using the dictionary correctly  requires that you understand the elements  of each entry If you glance at a SpanishEnglish dictionary  you will notice that its format is similar  to that of an English dictionary The word  is listed first usually followed by its  pronunciation Then come the definitions  organized by parts of speech Sometimes  the most frequently used definitions are  listed first To find the best word for your needs you  should refer to the abbreviations and the  explanatory notes that appear next to the  entries For example imagine that you are  writing about your pastimes You want to  write I want to buy a new racket for my  match tomorrow but you dont know the  Spanish word for racket In the dictionary  you may find an entry like this racket s 1 alboroto 2 raqueta dep The abbreviation key at the front of the  dictionary says that s corresponds to  sustantivo noun Then the first word  you see is alboroto The definition of  alboroto is noise or racket so alboroto  is probably not the word youre looking  for The second word is raqueta followed  by the abbreviation dep which stands for  deportes This indicates that the word  raqueta is the best choice for your needs recursos pp 165166 pp 6364
